## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Creating Flashcards

#### Via Toolbar Icon

1. Select a string of text or take a screenshot.
2. Click the **WordCards icon** in the Obsidian toolbar to generate a new flashcard from the clipboard content.

#### Via Command Palette

1. Select text or take a screenshot.
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
3. Search for `Get clipboard content, query GPT, and create a new note` and execute the command.

#### Using the Commander Plugin
[[Plugin Link]](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander)
This plugin allows you to use commands in various ways and even combine multiple commands.

You can even configure it to create flashcards with a single click in PDF++ (yes, I‚Äôm that lazy).

<img src="./others/commanderËÆæÁΩÆ1.png" alt="command settings" width="60%">

Add a command to include PDF++‚Äôs copy link command, then add a short delay followed by our flashcard command.

Once this command is created, you can place it anywhere using the Commander plugin.

### Workflow Scenarios

- **Clipboard Contains Text**:
  - If the clipboard contains word text, activating WordCards will create a flashcard with translations, definitions, example sentences, and other detailed information based on the configured prompts.

- **Clipboard Contains Image**:
  - If the clipboard contains an image, WordCards will upload the image to Imgur, use GPT-4 to analyze the image content, and create a flashcard that includes the extracted information and the image.

- **Processing Active File**:
  - Depending on the type of the current active file (e.g., Markdown or PDF), WordCards will process the content accordingly, creating new flashcards or appending to existing ones.

## üôÉ About Me

I‚Äôm just an international student living in Japan (currently working), with my Japanese skills at a basic level. However, I realized I still need to continue learning English (probably because I dislike English, I chose Japan ORZ). In my spare time, I teach myself programming and develop various small software projects (mostly in Python).
